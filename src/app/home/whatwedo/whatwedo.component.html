        <p>To increase the ability of more than 800 grassroots organisations, Indian Social Responsibility Network has
            periodically
            organised a number of seminars and training programmes. It will aid our extended network of partners and
            enable them to
            be structured into efficient, well-managed organisations that make best use of their people and financial
            resources to
            preserve business sustainability. The Training Program strives to empower NGOs by giving effective
            strategies, cutting-edge
            tools, as well as the specialised skills and techniques required to grow their potential. This will enable
            the
            organisations to operate effectively both internally and towards the community they serve. Our devoted
            team's current
            effort on various theme concepts has allowed us to concentrate on four key areas: agriculture, education,
            health, and
            capacity building. Through motivated ground team members and a group of volunteers, our team leads have
            covered the last
            mile in each of these diﬀerent thematic domains.

            <p>Indian Social Responsibility Network along with the team of Centre for Digital Financial Inclusion initiated a village 
                development plan in the Tarapur Village of Neemuch district and Behpur village of Mandsaur district in Madhya Pradesh.
                 A survey for need assessment was carried out to develop SAGY Gram Panchayats as model Gram Panchayats so that all 
                 the relevant government schemes, projects and resources are executed properly. The data collection in the gram 
                 panchayat was carried out through an app called KoBoCollect.  The app has two different forms, one for data from 
                 households and another for data about the villages.
                <br>
                On the basis of the data, CDFI and ISRN will prepare the VDP with the involvement of village panchayat members 
                and village functionaries. CDFI and ISRN will also plan for the resource mobilisation, project planning, implementation
                 strategy and facilitation towards fulfilling the needs of VDP.
