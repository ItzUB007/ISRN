                For years, scholars have been examining how power, oppression, and control are contested through
                patriarchal systems within the domestic domain and family. In India, the feminist movement has
                experienced strong political and social movements aimed at combating gendered violence that occurs
                within the family, particularly in the context of domestic violence. In todayâ€™s time, India is home to
                16% of the world's female population and shockingly, a report by IIPS & ICF (2017) reveals that 31% of
                women in India have faced physical or sexual violence at the hands of their intimate partners. This form
                of violence, defined by the World Health Organization as intimate partner violence, is a pervasive
                problem that encompasses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as controlling behaviours
                perpetrated by an intimate partner. These alarming statistics serve as a stark reminder of the urgent
                need to address this issue and work towards creating a safer environment for women in India.

                With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, women worldwide, including those in India, had faced
                increasingly severe challenges. One of the most alarming increases was the surge in domestic violence,
                with a staggering 1,477 complaints recorded in the first lockdown of March 25th - May 31st, 2020 - more
                than in the preceding decade during the same period. The lockdowns and restrictions meant that homes
                became hotspots for violence against women, especially for intimate partner violence. Sadly, such cases
                often go unreported, leaving women vulnerable and deprived of their human rights, health, dignity, and
                safety.

                The Indian Social Responsibility Network, in partnership with USAID, in March & April 2021 embarked on a
                mission to combat the grave issue of intimate partner violence and its negative impact on family
                planning. Their objective was to create awareness among the masses and impart knowledge about IPV to
                remove any obstacles that may hinder access to family planning methods. The campaign also popularized a
                helpline for counseling, which was made available to the public. The impact of their efforts was
                significant as they trained over 650 officials, NGO officials, ASHA, AWW, outreach workers, volunteers,
                and organizations on the issue.

                The ISRN also reached out to over 18,000 people in Delhi and more than 10,500 in other states through
                their outreach programs. Their social media campaign on FP-IPV had a staggering reach of over 248,320
                people, and as a result five media houses covered their efforts. The FP-IPV Campaign aimed to empower
                women to break the silence on intimate partner violence, build their trust in the Helpline number, and
                provide them with quality family planning information and counselling support. Moreover, to help women
                make informed decisions regarding contraceptive methods, let's stand with ISRN to break the silence on
                IPV and empower them to ultimately take charge of their lives
